    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Tiramisu, a timeless Italian dessert, is an exquisite symphony of flavors and textures that captivates the senses.
        Its name, "tiramisu," translates to "pick-me-up" or "lift-me-up," and that's precisely what this desert does. Each 
        indulgent bite is  a harmonious blend of delicate coffee-soaked ladyfingers, layered with a velvety mascarpone cheese mixture.
        The coffee infusion offers a gentle bitterness, beautifully balanced by the sweetness of the creamy mascarpone
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Strong Coffee</li>
        <li>Coffee Liqueur</li>
        <li>Mascarpone Cheese</li>
        <li>Egg Yolks</li>
        <li>Granulated Sugar</li>
        <li>Vanilla Extract</li>
        <li>Ladyfingers</li>
        <li>Cocoa Powder</li>
        <li>Dark Chocolate</li>
        <li>Whipped Cream</li>
        <li>Chocolate Shavings</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Brew strong coffee and let it cool to room temperature.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, beat egg yolks and sugar together until pale and creamy.</li>
        <li>Add mascarpone cheese and vanilla extract. Mix until smooth and well combined.</li>
        <li>Quickly dip each ladyfinger into the coffee mixture, ensuring they are soaked but not soggy.</li>
        <li>Arrange a layer of soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a serving dish (e.g., a trifle dish or a rectangular dish).</li>
        <li>Spread half of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers.</li>
        <li>Create another layer of soaked ladyfingers on top of the mascarpone mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the remaining mascarpone mixture on top.</li>
        <li>Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, or preferably overnight. Chilling allows the flavors to meld and the dessert to set.</li>
        <li>Before serving, dust the top of the Tiramisu with cocoa powder using a fine sieve.</li>
        <li>Optionally, garnish with freshly whipped cream and chocolate shavings or curls.</li>
    </ol>
